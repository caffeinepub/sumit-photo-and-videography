# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the site UI more colorful and visually appealing with a cohesive, modern theme that works in both light and dark mode (not primarily blue/purple).

**Planned changes:**
- Refresh global Tailwind/CSS theme tokens (primary/accent/muted/border/ring) to a more colorful modern palette, ensuring readability/accessibility in light and dark mode.
- Apply the updated theme consistently across all major sections/pages (Header, Footer, Home, Photos, Videos, Events, Special Moments, Business Info, Admin) with cohesive treatments for section headers, cards/containers, and call-to-action areas (gradients, accent borders, shadows).
- Improve styling for key “options” and controls (select dropdown triggers/menus, badges/status indicators, filters, tabs if present, admin form inputs) including hover/selected/disabled/error/focus-visible states.
- Enforce one coherent visual direction across the UI (consistent gradient style, spacing rhythm, typography emphasis, and component hierarchy) so no page feels visually inconsistent.

**User-visible outcome:** The entire website (including admin screens) looks more colorful and polished, with consistent styling across sections and clearly styled interactive controls in both light and dark mode.
