  "summary": "The diff restores top-level routes and header navigation for Photos/Videos/Events (and several additional sections), but it introduces placeholder/non-functional admin management sections and appears to break existing Orders functionality by stubbing backend calls in frontend query hooks. Some unrequested UI/branding changes were also added (footer link and mandatory profile setup modal).",

      "requirement": "Admin panel navigation and sections beyond Orders must provide functional UI (at least listing existing entities and create/update/delete or upload flows where applicable), not empty/placeholder content.",
      "reason": "The restored admin sections shown are explicitly placeholders (\"coming soon\"), with disabled primary action buttons and no listing/CUD flows.",
