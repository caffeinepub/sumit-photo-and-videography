  "summary": "The diff clearly implements a more vibrant theme via global CSS tokens and applies colorful/gradient/glass styling across several key pages (Header, Footer, Home, Photos, Events, Special Moments, Admin). However, evidence is missing for some required major sections (notably Videos and Business Info), and the styling improvements for certain controls (badges/status + admin form focus/error states) are not fully verifiable from the truncated diff. There are also repo-meta changes not requested by the styling requirements.",
