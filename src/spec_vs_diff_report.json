  "summary": "Diff adds an order-status-aware OrdersSection UI, React Query hooks/types for status filtering and status updates, and a Motoko migration module wired into backend/main.mo. However, several backend requirements (status persistence, admin-only enforcement, and conditional migration behavior) are not verifiable from the truncated backend diff, and there are extra meta/project summary files not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Backend Order data includes a status field (Pending/Fulfilled/Cancelled), defaults new orders to an initial status (e.g., Pending), and allows admins to update status without changing immutable order id and existing order date.",
      "reason": "Frontend is updated to use OrderStatus and update status, but backend/main.mo is truncated before any Order type/method implementations, so the status field, defaulting behavior on create, and immutability constraints for id/orderDate cannot be confirmed from the provided diff evidence.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (truncated)",
        "frontend/src/components/admin/OrdersSection.tsx"

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add backend canister methods and React Query hooks to support status and status updates, enforcing admin-only access for mutations and appropriate access for queries.",
      "reason": "React Query hooks appear to exist, but the diff does not show the actual order/status-related hook implementations (portion of useQueries.ts is truncated) nor any backend method definitions or admin-only authorization checks for status mutation methods (backend/main.mo is truncated).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Provide a conditional Motoko migration when adding status changes stable state shape, initializing default status for existing orders on upgrade.",
      "reason": "A migration module is added that sets status to #Pending, but there is no evidence that the migration is conditional (only runs when upgrading from older state lacking the field). The wiring shown in backend/main.mo does not demonstrate any conditional logic by itself.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/migration.mo",
        "backend/main.mo (truncated)"

    },
    {
      "requirement": "Backend must remain a single Motoko actor with all logic in backend/main.mo.",
      "reason": "A new Motoko source file backend/migration.mo is added containing migration logic, which places backend logic outside backend/main.mo.",
      "evidence": [
